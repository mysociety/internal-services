<h1>Gaze - the mySociety Gazetteer web service</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>There is general information about Gaze in the 
<a href="http://www.mysociety.org/?p=83">blog post which announced its launch</a>,
and another <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/?p=96">blog post about population density</a>.

<h3>Language specific APIs</h3>

<p>Use the REST based API as described below.</p>

<p>Perl users can use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/WWW-MySociety-Gaze/">WWW::MySociety::Gaze</a>, which wraps the REST API.</p>

<h3>Usage instructions</h3>
<p>
When calling
        <a href="/gaze-rest">http://gaze.mysociety.org/gaze-rest</a>
parameter f is always the function name, with the following parameters. 
The content of the page returned is whitespace seperated, except where otherwise specified.
</p>


<h4><a href="/gaze-rest?f=get_country_from_ip;ip=130.88.200.10">get_country_from_ip</a></h4>
<ul>
	<li>"ip" is the IP address to lookup</li>
</ul>
<p>
           Return the ISO country code for the given IP address, or
           undef if none could be found.
</p>


<h4><a href="/gaze-rest?f=get_coords_from_ip;ip=130.88.200.10">get_coords_from_ip</a></h4>
<ul>
	<li> "ip" is the IP address to lookup</li>
</ul>
<p>
           Return latitude and longitude of the centre of the country for the
           given IP address, or undef if none could be found.
</p>

<h4><a href="/gaze-rest?f=get_find_places_countries">get_find_places_countries</a></h4>
<p>This function takes no parameters and returns list of
   countries which find_places will work for (one item per line).
</p>


<h4><a href="/gaze-rest?f=find_places;country=US;query=Manchester">find_places</a></h4>
<ul>
        <li>"country" is the ISO country code to search for places</li>
        <li>"state" is the optional state within a country to search in.</li>
        <li>"query" is the name being looked for.</li>
        <li>"maxresults" is the maximum results to return (optional)</li>
        <li>"minscore" is the smallest percentage score for results.</li>
</ul>

<p>
           Returns a CSV file of places in COUNTRY (ISO code) which match
           the given search QUERY.  The country must be from the
           list returned by get_find_places_countries.  STATE, if
           specified, is a customary code for a top-level
           administrative subregion within the given
           COUNTRY; at present, this is only useful for the
           United States. 
</p>
<p>
           Returns a set of lines, in the format 
<pre>
                NAME, IN, NEAR, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, STATE, SCORE
</pre>
           When IN is defined,
           it gives the name of a region in which the place lies;
           when NEAR is defined, it gives a short list of other
           places near to the returned place.  These allow
           nonunique names to be disambiguated by the user.
           LATITUDE and LONGITUDE are in decimal degrees,
           north- and east-positive, in WGS84. Earlier
           entries in the returned list are better matches
           to the query.

           At most MAXRESULTS (default, 20) results, and only
           results with score at least MINSCORE (default 0, per-
           centage from 0 to 100) are returned. The MAXRESULTS
           limit is ignored when the top results all have the
           same relevancy. They are all returned. So for example,
           this means that if you search for Cambridge in the US
           with MAXRESULTS of 5, it will return all the
           Cambridges, even though there are more than 5 of
           them.
</p>

<h4><a href="/gaze-rest?f=get_country_bounding_coords;country=GB">get_country_bounding_coords</a></h4>
<ul>
        <li>"country" is the ISO country code to return co-ordinates for</li>
</ul>
<p>
           Returns a space sperated line containing the latitude of
           the most northerly and southernly places, and the lon-
           gitude of the most easterly and westerly places in
           COUNTRY. (NB these will always lie *inside* the true
           bounding coordinates of the COUNTRY itself.)
</p>


<h4><a href="/gaze-rest?f=get_population_density;lat=53.4780349399915;lon=-2.2443008422851562">get_population_density</a></h4>
<ul>
  <li>"lat" is the latitude, north-positive in decimal degrees</li>
  <li>"lon" is the longtitude, east-positive in decimal degrees</li>
</ul>
<p>
           Returns an estimate of the population density at (LAT,
           LON) in persons per square kilometer.
</p>
 
<h4><a href="/gaze-rest?f=get_radius_containing_population;lat=53.4780349399915;lon=-2.2443008422851562;number=1000000">get_radius_containing_population</a></h4>
<ul>
  <li>"lat" is the latitude, north-positive in decimal degrees</li>
  <li>"lon" is the longtitude, east-positive in decimal degrees</li>
  <li>"number" is the population</li>
  <li>"maximum" is the maximum radius to return (default 150, optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>
          Return an estimate of the radius (in km) of the
          smallest circle around (LAT, LON) which contains
          at least NUMBER people. If MAXIMUM is defined,
          return that value rather than any larger computed
          radius; if not specified, use 150km.
</p>

<h4><a href="/gaze-rest?f=get_places_near;lat=53.4780349399915;lon=-2.2443008422851562;number=1000000;distance=100">get_places_near</a></h4>
<ul>
  <li>"lat" is the latitude, north-positive in decimal degrees</li>
  <li>"lon" is the longtitude, east-positive in decimal degrees</li>
  <li>"population" is the number of persons to calculate circle radius (optional)</li>
  <li>"distance" is the maximum distance population (optional)</li>
  <li>"country" is the ISO country code to limit results to (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>Population or Distance must be specified</p>
<p>
           Returns a CSV formatted page of all the places
           within a given distance of a point expressed as LAT
           LON.  PARAMS include: * DISTANCE to include all
           results within DISTANCE km * POPULATION to include all
           results within a circle containing at
           least POPULATION people * MAXDISTANCE, can be supplied
	   with POPULATION to bound the distance returned *
           COUNTRY to bound results to one COUNTRY
